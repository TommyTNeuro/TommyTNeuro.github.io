Compuational Neuroscientist specalising in brain computer interfaces. My focus is on leveraging foundational transformer models to improved decoding performance in imagined speech decoding. This is in an effort to work toward reasearch in real-time speech decoding by leveraging these techniques and creating highly performant, low compute models. 

I hope to leverage the unique power of novel techniques to push the boundries of decoding neural data using non-invasive brain imaging techniques. In particular I would like to leverage OPM-MEGs with their unique stengthes in real-time neural feedback and superior spatial localisation compare to other techniques to achieve this effect. I would like to also leverage memory safe languages in critical components in these BCI's to ensure stability and consistency to be able to apply this technology in a clinical setting. 

This research has promising impacts for those with speech problems due to damage or psychiatric conditions.
